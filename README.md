# Docker_Microservice_NetCore
Sample micro-service project build with .Net Core and Docker container.

This is a simple project which is build in a micro service architecture. As you know in a micro service archtitecture the developer can choose different technologies for different services which enables the project to use best suitable technologies for each service. 

For this sample project I am using .NET CORE for as a service and reactJS for another microservice. 

Also using DOCKER container to wrap each micro-service so that it can be deployed to any system or anywhere independently of other services.

Thanks!!!
